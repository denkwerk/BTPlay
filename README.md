======

Code samples from my BTPlay presentation &quot;You want to do WHAT?! with JavaScript&quot;

Note:
I will try to clean up the codebase a bit to make sure the examples are understandable
to everyone who is capable in reading and writing javascript.


###How to play?!###

You need node.js to be installed on your system!
Go to the folder of the example you would like play around with and execute

```shell
node server.js
```

This will start up a webserver you can reach via 

```shell
localhost:[port_of_the_example]/
```

The examples will be run under the following ports:

+ presentation -> (HTTP)8089 / (Websocket)8089

+ getUserMedia -> (HTTP)8001 / (Websocket)8011
+ pictureUserMedia -> (HTTP)8002 / (Websocket)8012
+ streamUserMedia -> (HTTP)8003 / (Websocket)8013

+ shinyLed -> (HTTP)8004 / (Websocket)8014
+ trollDetecor -> (HTTP)8005 / (Websocket)8015

+ kinectFireworks -> (HTTP)8006 / (Websocket)8016
+ kinectPong -> (HTTP)8007 / (Websocket)8017
+ kinectControl -> (HTTP)8010

+ beyond3d -> (HTTP)8008 / (Websocket)8018
+ beyond3dcube -> (HTTP)8009 / (Websocket)8019

If you have questins regarding one of the examples,
feel free to use the issue tracker!


###Disclaimer###

This repository features a lot of libraries and code written by other people who do really smart things,
also, some of the examples i´ve shown contain code from other people.
